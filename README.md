## Description
GreenVulcano is an open-source integration platform, based on a stable, robust and industry-proven bus, able to connect multiple heterogeneous systems. Its plug-in architecture allows for unlimited expansion and customization, providing the right solution to many different business integration problems.

## Upcoming Version 4
We've been working hard in the past few months in order to add exciting new features to our integration platform, including:
* **Modularization** - no more heavy application server required to run GreenVulcano: it comes as a modular, stand-alone application, based on an OSGi architecture.
* **Embedding** - you can run slimmed-down versions of GreenVulcano on resource-constrained devices
* **IoT** - new protocols added and a completely new IoT platform to manage, monitor and control your IoT devices, and to get live analytics out of the collected data. Also, Field Gateway functionality is provided (see `gvlib-*`)
* **Cloud** - GreenVulcano 4 is made for the Cloud, and the Cloud is made for GreenVulcano 4. Hybrid private/public cloud are supported and easy to set up.
